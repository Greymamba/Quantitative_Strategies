# Arbitrage with Cross-Exchange Example
This includes a notebook **Pure_Arbitrage.ipynb** that discusses the high level overview on what Arbitrage is and how it can be applied to Crypto Exchanges.
As of 11/22/2021, you can't trade crypto (BTC) on Eikon/Reuters. However, Reuters does keep track of BTC prices. In the notebook I provided, I **assumed** (for educational purposes) that Reuters would be an **exchange**. So, in the notebook, treat Reuters as if it were another crypto exchange.
